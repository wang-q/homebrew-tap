# My tap for unbrewed repos

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install wang-q/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap wang-q/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wang-q/tap/master/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme).

[A great post](http://formalfriday.club/2015/01/05/creating-your-own-homebrew-tap-and-formula.html) about setting up a tap.
